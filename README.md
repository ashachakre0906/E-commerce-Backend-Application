## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Installation
* Install Node in your computer by going to `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
* Create .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ and .env/ so that the directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
* Create a new github repository and clone it to your local machine.
* Navigate to the repo which you just created by typing`cd` command  and open it in your code editor by typing the command in your terminal `code .`
* `npm i` to install the `node_modules`
* `dotenv` package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your  MySQL username, password, and database name.
* Following packages needed to to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database 
  - `MySQL2` 
  - `Sequelize` 
* run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that we can test our routes.
* Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start.
  - `nodemon server.js`

## Usage
### Code Examples and Screenshots
***Function generateCards() will generate the cards dynamically for Manager,Employee and Intern through forloop***
```
function generateCards(data) {
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    if (data[i].getRole() == "Manager") {
      let str = `
         <div class="card mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
            <div class="card-header"><h3>${data[i].getName()}</h3><i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot"></i> Manager
            </div>
            <div class="card-body text-dark">
              <h5 class="card-title"></h5>
              <p class="card-text"></p>
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">id: ${data[i].getId()}</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Email: <a href = "mailto:${data[i].getEmail()}">${data[i].getEmail()}</a></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Office number: ${data[i].getOfficeNumber()}</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
         </div>
    `;
      cards += str;
```
## Tests
Our application is using Jest package for running the suite of unit tests.In order to run jest tests for Employee,Engineer,Intern and Manager classes we need to enter the following command in the terminal.All the tests must PASS.
